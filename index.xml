The panels evaluating applicant across both rounds will be likely different, and you can apply multiple times if you wish so.</description></item><item><title>Industry, transportation, and natural sciences</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/curricula_ind/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/curricula_ind/</guid><description>Description Introduction Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are driving the digital transformation of industries, transportation, and cities. The pace of innovation in these areas is continuously reshaping the scientific and industrial scene, constantly creating new opportunities and research questions. Their impact ranges from smart management of production lines to adaptive approaches in logistic and supply chains and to autonomous driving vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Law and AI</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/courses/law-and-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/courses/law-and-ai/</guid><description>The course on ‘Law and AI’ focuses on how current and prospective legal rules constrain and govern data science and AI applications, especially in the European legal framework. The course will explore the general legal requirements currently applicable to data science and AI applications in Europe, as well as the ongoing debate on prospective legal measures that could in the future apply in the field.</description></item><item><title>Medicine, Life Sciences, and Environment</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/curricula_ls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/curricula_ls/</guid><description>Description Introduction Life Sciences, broadly including Medicine, Healthcare and Public Health Sciences, drive conception and development of technologies that in the last decades have been impacting our society the most. The general context is to understand complex biological phenomena, measure the effect of therapeutical interventions on single patients and across the population and enhance our ability to predict disease trajectories in single individuals, as well as in the broader society.</description></item><item><title>MISSION</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/mission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/mission/</guid><description>Mission Across all fields, technological development is fostering the collection of large amounts of complex datasets that require advanced data science skills to be organised, processed and successfully mined.

We review the whole setting of likelihood theory, with a special focus on maximum likelihood estimation, properties of maximum likelihood estimators and a brief review of hypothesis testing. We deepen then linear and generalized linear models, covering the basic theory of these modeling techniques, the main inferential tools and proposing applications with real and complex data.</description></item><item><title>Statistical methods for clinical prediction models and causal inference</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/courses/statistical-methods-for-clinical-prediction-models-and-causal-inference-an-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/courses/statistical-methods-for-clinical-prediction-models-and-causal-inference-an-introduction/</guid><description>In this course, we will briefly introduce the principal study designs in epidemiology and clinical research. Then, according to the objectives of the study, we will describe the statistical approaches underlying the two main aims in health research, i.e. predicting prognosis and estimating the causal effect of specific exposures on the outcomes.</description></item><item><title>Students</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/_students/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/_students/</guid><description>2021 Cohort Student Email Bachelor of Science Master of Science ADSAI supervisor(s) External supervisors Topic Alice Antonello alice.antonello@phd.units.it Biotechnology (University of Turin) Quantitative and Computational Biology (University of Trento) Giulio Caravagna Computational methods for tumor evolution Giovanni Baj giovanni.baj@phd.units.it Physics (University of Insubria) Physics (University of Insubria) Giulia Barbati Arjuna Scagnetto (ASUGI) Applications of AI in Health Care Lorenzo Basile lorenzo.</description></item><item><title>The ADSAI PhD program</title><link>https://adsai.units.it/phd-program/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.units.it/phd-program/</guid><description>“Artificial Intelligence is the new electricity.” Andrew Ng, Co-founder and lead of Google Brain.
