Network analysis is an in-demand approach to data analysis because it identifies underlying structures within data characterized by complex dependence structures. This short course will examine the most recent developments in statistical methods for analyzing and modeling the structure and dynamics of complex networks.</description></item><item><title>Advanced topics in Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/advanced-topics-in-reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/advanced-topics-in-reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>This short course will address issues in Multi-agent reinforcement learning, from Markov games and the connection with game theory to multi-armed bandit algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Advanced topics in statistical modeling</title><link>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/artificial-intelligence-in-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/artificial-intelligence-in-society/</guid><description>The course extends basic statistical models through the introduction of multilevel/ hierarchical models, semi and non-parametric regression models, spline functions, penalized likelihood approaches (such as LASSO and Ridge regression models), and hierarchical models for estimating smooth regression functions.

At the same time, AI is increasingly implicated in controversies around its applications. Such an ambivalent public image of AI has led scientific societies, firms, governments and regulators to become more active in issuing blueprints, strategies, and regulations aimed at steering AI towards desirable social goals, while averting negative impacts on society. The Module will discuss the societal implications of AI, by reviewing the social and ethical aspects of this field and by fostering students&amp;rsquo; imagination and reflection on possible ways to make concrete R&amp;amp;I processes more socially responsible.</description></item><item><title>Biodiversity Informatics</title><link>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/biodiversity-informatics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/biodiversity-informatics/</guid><description>The course aims at providing basic knowledge to organize, manage, and use biodiversity databases, both at management and research level.

Moreover, it surveys recent and significant research works on evolutionary robotics, highlighting their methodological aspects and their potential applicability to other domains. Concerning evolutionary computation, beyond key components, the course covers its application to the optimization of neural networks. Finally, the course introduces the reality gap problem and briefly surveys the main mitigation strategies.</description></item><item><title>Explainable AI</title><link>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/evolutionary-robotics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/evolutionary-robotics/</guid><description>The course on explainable artificial intelligence deals with the hot topic of identifying either efficient models that are also human comprehensible or to build explanations from highly efficient but black-box deep learning models. We will describe from a high level perspective the different approaches for deep learning models (e.g. local and global approximations/distillations and feature ranking) and also introduce some ideas from neuro-symbolic computing, attempting to combine logic and deep learning.</description></item><item><title>Law and AI</title><link>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/law-and-ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://adsai.inginf.units.it/courses/law-and-ai/</guid><description>The course on ‘Law and AI’ focuses on how current and prospective legal rules constrain and govern data science and AI applications, especially in the European legal framework.

Then, according to the objectives of the study, we will describe the statistical approaches underlying the two main aims in health research, i.e. predicting prognosis and estimating the causal effect of specific exposures on the outcomes. In the first case the focus will be on describing the main steps involved in building a reliable prediction model (from the selection of covariates to the internal and external validation).</description></item></channel></rss>
